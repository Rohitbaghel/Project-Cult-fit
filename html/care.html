                    A Therapists' goal is to help patients make decisions and clarify their feelings in order to solve problems without any
                    medication. A Psychiatrist, on the other hand, helps diagnose mental health issues, and prescribes medicines if needed.
                    However, Therapists often works in tandem with a Psychiatrist to provide comprehensive care as needed by any user.

                    <h5>Online personal Training</h5>
                    <p>More and more people are realizing the importance of staying fit and healthy. With a sedentary
                        lifestyle becoming more of a norm these days, it has become essential to find time in your busy
                        schedule for a physical workout. If you are on a time crunch, it might be difficult to squeeze
                        out enough time to go to a training centre or a gym to get your workout done. This is where
                        online personal training comes in handy. You do not need to waste any time commuting, yet still,
                        get access to online personal training from the comfort of your home. An online personal
                        training program constitutes undergoing training under the guidance of a certified personal
                        trainer over a video call. The trainer will be able to guide you through the different workouts
                        and keep an eye on whether or not you are following perfect form while working out. An Online
                        Fitness Trainer is well versed in coaching clients online. You will be able to make the most of
                        each session and burn a lot of calories as you put your body through a vigorous workout. One
                        concern that most people have about joining an online personal training program is about
                        investing in workout equipment. Fortunately, online fitness coaches are trained to design
                        workout programs based on the workout equipment you have at home. Online training is a flexible
                        and cost-effective way to reach your fitness targets without having to rely on the trainer’s
                        location or availability.</p>
                    <h5>How Online Personal Training Works?</h5>
                    <p>Online personal training is a relatively new concept. Ever since its conception, more people have
                        started switching to this type of training because of the many benefits it offers. Online
                        training can be described as an exciting way to start training under the guidance of a certified
                        personal trainer at a fraction of the cost without having to worry about the logistics or travel
                        time. Most online coaching programs have different packages based on the difficulty level as
                        well as the number of hours you will get with the coach. You can pick a package that meets your
                        requirements. If you are a beginner, it is advisable to start with one of the basic packages and
                        then top up as you get more proficient with the help of the online gym trainer. The packages
                        will also give you an outline of what to expect, any equipment you might need, and so on. The
                        number of sessions included in the package will also be mentioned. Once you choose a package,
                        you can choose from the different time slots available. Log in on the chosen day and time and
                        start working out. You will need to leave your video and microphone on in order to be able to
                        communicate with the trainer during your sessions. The trainer will demonstrate the different
                        workouts and keep a close eye on your posture and form. The trainer will also give you plenty of
                        input on how you are doing. Basically, an online personal training program involves the
                        following steps: Signing up for a Personal Training journey and choosing a pack of your choice.
                        Setting your fitness goal and getting started accordingly. Choosing from the wide variety of
                        available workouts. Following the guidance of the trainers. Achieving your goals with regular
                        assessments and sessions. The initial sessions of most online personal training programs are
                        less intense to help you ease your body into workout mode. As you attend more online sessions,
                        you will notice that your body has built up stamina and can handle intense workout sessions with
                        more ease. Since these Personal Training sessions are one on one, you can work out at your pace
                        and benefit from the vast knowledge of the Online Personal Trainer you have chosen.</p>

                        be motivated to stay on track and keep up with your workout routine and diet regime. You will
